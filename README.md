# Congressional Gridlock Analysis
This program contains functions to process and analyze congressional data. It uses a multiple regression with explanatory variables political polarization, congress control, and house of representatives margin with the response variable being the proportion of bills passed. This was written to help with my Junior AP Stats final project.
